# Car_AI
A simulation of AI powered car. The AI that operates on fuzzy logic slows down and increases the speed of the car untill it stops near the 'wall'.


It was a project for my university. I was tasked with creating a file containing fuzzy logic (JFuzzyLogic) and then I created a .cpp file that contained this logic which took the distance at which the car started and the velocity that it starts at. It then calculates how many meters it traveld any given second, adjusting the speed to stop near the obstacle.
